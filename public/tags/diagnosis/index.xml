      <title>Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) composition in relation to risk of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) – Nathan Lewis, Lars Bode</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A follow up on findings showing the mitigation of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) in a mouse model after administration of combined Human Milk Oligosaccharide (HMO) as well as a single HMO: DSLNT. We found that consecutive depletion of DSLNT in the mother’s milk was correlated with NEC onset in the infant. This finding is consistent with the pre-clinical rat model suggesting that DSLNT provides a significant protective effect for preterm infants from NEC.
The project will continue with the prediction of HMO biosynthesis pathways from gene expression data and the examination of microbiome contributions to NEC onset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transform Autism through Early Diagnosis - Nathan Lewis, Eric Couchesne</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project we are examining leukocyte RNAseq data collected from toddles evaluated at the Autism Center for Excellence.
Subjects have had a comprehensive range of behavior phenotyping over the first several years of life.
We hope to uncover the intrinsic dimensiality of the behavior-space defining Autism. We will create an informative diagnostic and prognostic tool for Autism by associating those composite behaviors with gene group regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

In this project we are examining leukocyte RNAseq data collected from toddles evaluated at the Autism Center for Excellence. 
Subjects have had a comprehensive range of behavior phenotyping over the first several years of life. 
We hope to uncover the intrinsic dimensiality of the behavior-space defining Autism. We will create an informative diagnostic and prognostic tool for Autism by associating those composite behaviors with gene group regulation.

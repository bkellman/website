## Why raise money for AAAS

Today, advocates need money to be heard by our representatives. To that end, I would like to raise some money for these scientific advocates, AAAS.

100% of donations will go directly to the AAAS Office of Government Relations. These are the folks responsible for interfacing with congress.

## More on AAAS

Scientists need representation! Representation can pressure legislators to take climate change, research funding, knowledge, and academics seriously. AAAS is that organization.

I just joined the AAAS. If you take the opinion and work of academics seriously, join the AAAS today. Get academics the representation we need to be heard, pressure our representatives to rely on facts and reason in their decision making.

I would encourage everyone in and out of academia to join AAAS. Please encourage your friends and colleagues to do the same. #GiveKnowledgeAVoice

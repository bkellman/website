Sitting in a bar on a cool night in June one night in June a classmate asked me if binfo could ever capture sufficiently describe mol bio. 

I responded simply from aristotleâ€™s sum of parts.

Can binfo do mol bio?
binfo is flat information, no depth of understanding
1)-binfo as is, great for correlation - egg consumption and civil engineer doctorates [spurious correlations]
->Yes. mol bio is a finite number of examinations, can be replicated.
-> thinking of every ome as a set of mol bio experiments, as long as they dont stand alone.  They require, as in mol bio, information across omic levels to be informative and thorough
2)-binfo is exploratory no question. 
->re thinking as hypothesis driven science questions about fundamental laws of signal transduction and other processes can be examined
->is the network robust, how can we describe the robustness
->decomposing a diffuse netowrk into theory redefines its description


finite number of mol bio experiments, can approach with multi omic and right perspective

-explain questions posed by omic data points

-gi -> how?, answer ppi
-> epistasis pred from ppi

-> principals of network -> what makes a netowrk good

Defining an ideal network and a function on which the network, any network can be evaluated for goodness.
-> failure points and types of failures can be identified



--------
2 parts
-trans omics approaches mol bio -> allows sufficient detail for omic scale hypotheses about the axioms of biology
-one such axiom is robustness
	-preato optimality (alon)
-dynamic description of networks - function of the ideal
	-predicts network failure and categories of network failure

# Running with scissors: taking stupid results and running with them

## *The Bell Curve*, 1994, Charles A. Murray and Richard Herrnstein

# The flaw: Different groups have different averages, BUT, the differences are neglegable relative to the variability

**So, yea, men are better at spacial reasoning. BUT. That means basically nothing.**

The problem is, there are several men and women in the world. Just as there are several black people in the world. When you discuss the average of a group of this size, you end up with a mostly meaningless statistic. There is so much you are trying to summarize in one number, you basically learn nothing.

I'm not disputing the findings of *The Bell Curve*. That has been done and well. I'm saying that even if they were right. It is dumb. Saying that men are better spacial reasoners or that blacks have lower IQ than whites is dumb becuase of the small difference and high variability. It is as useful as saying:
- The moon is closer to the sun than earth.

# So just how many men are smarter than women?

60% smarter than the average women. 10% are smarter than a smart women...

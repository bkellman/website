# The Library of Bable

# Data-dumps and hairballs aren't just common place, they are exceptional

- Science and Nature publications of networks without findings
- databases and hairballs are inpenetrable

## Date heaps are our library of Bable
- 
- the signal is indestinguishable from the noise
- the noise tends to 

# What is hypothesis driven work and don't we do it?

It is the difference between the vageness of "mapping the landscape of interactions" and "describing a set of interactions necessary or sufficient to acheive a phenotype"

# Who cares if we do hypothesis driven work

- Nothing can be proved or disproved without a hypothesis
- Data-heaps are creating a mushy foundation for bioinformatics but few people are building up
- Stating a hypothesis, building or rebuking a provious theory is how we move forward and develop into a field
-- without this we are doomed to remain a toolset

# A step in the right direction

## NeXo

I have voiced in the past some concerns about this method but the work done in understanding autophogy is an excellent example of both the potential and pitfalls of big data.

NeXo is the "next ontology." it is the synthesis of coexpression data, protein protein interaction data and gene interaction data. the resulting hierarchy is typical to bioinformatics in that it is a mess of potential discovery Ladden with indistinguishable meaningful and erroneous associations.

the study of autophogy has .....

the NeXo team found....

their paper makes a classically bombastic claim in its title, insinuating that they have solved autophogy. in fact they provided insight toward understanding a key aspect of autophogy. a necessary change we need to make as bioinformatics is to value our biological insights and dismiss ourselves of the dietous misgivings. programming is awesome but it isn't holy. if we want to make scientific progress, we need to be clear about our findings. that way we can be right or wrong. a statement is necessary for progress. nobody cares if you "solved autophogy" because you didnt. but if you are clear about your findings, you can contribute to the ancient and robust tradition of hypothesis testing that has brought biology into the realm of good science

# About

Today, Ben is a Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology at the University of California, San Diego working in the Lewis Lab for Systems Biology and Cell Engineering. He is published and working in the application of systems biological perspectives in glycobiology.

His published work in Necrotizing Enterocolitis is the first study to reproduce preclinical protection of human milk sugars in humans. This work can hopefully be used to identify, prevent and treat this disease but also creates a new president to further examine human milk sugars, a clinically underappreciated biotherapeutic, as a new mode of clinical action. Ben is also working towards modeling the biosynthetic processes responsible for producing these human milk sugars to facilitate industrial production and enable supplementation.  

More broadly, he is working to increase the accessibility of glycobiology. Despite the [underrepresentation of glycans relative to the other four fundamental monomers in literature](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=biology%2Camino+acid%2Clipid%2Cnucleotide%2Cglycan&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbiology%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Camino%20acid%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Clipid%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cnucleotide%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cglycan%3B%2Cc0), glycans [encapsulate](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https:%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-pbi3iudBUrg%2FVvig1OTO18I%2FAAAAAAAAAIg%2FTWeiQDWxGOs0t003R1ClOKsyjo97y0D-A%2Fs1600%2Fglycocalyx.jpeg&imgrefurl=http:%2F%2Fnadiamicrobejournal.blogspot.com%2F2016%2F03%2F&docid=R8lrgYOSxKhqcM&tbnid=H0O2TZPc70fUlM:&vet=1&w=850&h=462&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim) the cell and are thereby positioned to moderate most, if not all, extracellular communication making them essential to multi-cellularity. It is thought that one of the reasons for this underrepresentation is the inaccessibility of the datatype. To counter this inaccessibility, Ben is working with the Lewis lab to share their glycan modeling platform which includes exhaustive [in prepreation] and stochastic [Spahn,2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2015.10.007) mechanistic modeling approaches for predicting and explaining glycoprofiles given glycoprofiling data. This platform will also soon include glycoprofile predictions directly from gene expression data which would expand the potential audience exponentially.

In his free time, Ben is an avid mountain biker and scientific advocate. He also organized the 2017 AAAS: Give Science a Voice Ride from San Diego to San Francisco. The trip involved professors, post-docs and graduate students from UCSD and UCLA. AAAS is an organization working to connect scientists with politicians to ensure the utilization and continuity of our public research infrastructure; making sure the taxpayers get a return on their research investments by connecting the best-informed people with the policymakers who need that information.  Raising over $5,500 and riding over 700 miles, Ben is looking forward to expanding the ride next year.
